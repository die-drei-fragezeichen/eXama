PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Students need to have an overview of their exams to better plan their studying during the school semester. Teachers need also to have an overview of all kind of graded projects (written exams, oral exams, presentations) in order to know when to best plan an exam and to know when their students workload is too high. Current planning tools used at schools do not show the workload and the design aspect is often neglected.

DESCRIPTION:
Our project is a browser-based (and app) planning tool to organize exam dates. Teachers can enter their exam dates which will be also visible to the students. The students will get an overview about their semester which will help them to better plan their studying. When the teachers enter their exam dates they specify also what kind of exam it is (written exam, vocabulary test, oral exam, presentation, project due). The tool translates the type of exam into a specific workload, for example a written exam would mean a higher workload than a vocabulary test. The workload which any student has during a semester will be shown in a visual way which is quick and easy to understand.

RATIONALE:
Current available exam date tools do not show the workloads the students have. They also do not show if a planned exam is a rather big or rather small exam for which students need need to study accordingly more or less. Also, teachers usually do not have an overview of oral exams, graded projects and presentations from other subject and therefore cannot estimate the time students have for their own subject. Our tool will not only give an overview of ALL type of graded projects which students have, and therefore their workload, it will also give a nice visual representation of it which current planning tools often lack.
