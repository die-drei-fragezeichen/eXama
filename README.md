PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In educational settings students often struggle to keep their academic assignments organized and their workload on track. Even though teachers have a fairly clear idea how much work their homework assignments mean for students, and even though schools normally have a strict policy as to how many exams are accepted over a given period of time, constant work overload is a widespread issue. At the same time, teachers battle with assessing their students’ study situation adequately when assigning homework tasks or planning exams. Current planning tools address these problems individually, but they fail to address the fact that both homework assignments and exam preparations are intertwined. Consequently, this leads to bad planning, insufficient academic performance and stress. Additionally, the absence of a useful tool leads to a situation in which these problems can hardly be addressed, assessed and dealt with. 

DESCRIPTION:
eXama is a web-based planning tool addressing the issue outlined above. Teachers enter homework assignments along with a workload expectation. If teachers set new exam dates, they also define examination types (e.g. normal or short tests, oral exams or project work). In their planning process, teachers immediately see their students' current workload and can take it into consideration. 
Once an entry is completed, eXama’s algorithm will translate this information into a general workload overview. Simultaneously, exam dates will be visualised in a semester plan. This information will then be available to all parties involved. eXama school admins can alter and individualise parameters for their school according to their predefined ideas. Once exam limits are reached, eXama will keep teachers from adding exams and increasing students’ workload further. Thus, a useful level of flexibility is also provided. 

RATIONALE:
Currently available planning tools in education do not adequately show the workloads students face. This makes effective and transparent planning difficult for both teachers and students. eXama’s weekly workload view and its clearly structured semester view help all parties improve their planning ability and organise study times. eXama appreciates the fact that different homework tasks and different exam types have an impact on a student’s overall study situation. Putting a rationale behind these different tasks allows keeping an overview of what is going on in students’ academic lives and by having this information, potential conflicts can be reduced and transparently addressed. When planning, teachers usually seek web-based solutions, while students are more used to retrieving information on mobile devices. Thus, both services will be available to maximise user satisfaction.
